/**
 * A Comparison is similiar to Comparable in that it compares
 * the equivalence of two Objects based on some specific condition,
 * however, unlike Comparable which returns either a -1, 0 or 1 
 * for use when Sorting objects, Comparison returns a simple boolean
 * response similar to a Predicate.
 * 
 * A Comparison is similar to the Guava Libraries Equivalence but 
 * differs semantically.. the purpose of an Equivalence is to test
 * whether two items are semantically equivalent to one another, either
 * in terms of equality, identity, or identical meaning. A 
 * Comparison, on the other hand, checks only to see if the two objects
 * adhere to some arbitrary comparison logic regardless of whether the
 * two objects are semantically equivalent.
