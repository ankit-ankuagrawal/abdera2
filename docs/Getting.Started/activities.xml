  <section title="Introduction">
  
  <t></t>
    
  </section>
    
  <section title="A Simple Activity">
  
  <t>An Activity represents an event that has occurred and consists of four 
  primary components:</t>
  
  <t><list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Actor">Identifies the entity that performed the action.</t>
    <t hangText="Verb">Identifies the action that was taken.</t>
    <t hangText="Object">Identifies the object that was acted upon.</t>
    <t hangText="Target">Identifies the object to which the action was directed.</t>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>For instance, given the sentence, "Joe posted a link to Sally's Profile", 
  "Joe" is the Actor, "posted" is the verb, "a link" is the object, and 
  "Sally's Profile" is the target.</t>
  
  <t>To represent this activity using the JSON Activity Streams Format using 
  Abdera2, we would use the following code:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
Activity activity =
  makeActivity()
    .actor(makePerson("Joe"))
    .verb(POST)
    .object(makeBookmark("http://example.org"))
    .target(makeService().displayName("Sally's Wall"))
    .get();
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>Once created, we can serialize the activity to the standardized JSON 
  format simply by calling the writeTo method on the activity:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
IO io = IO.make().prettyPrint().get();
activity.writeTo(io, System.out);
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>For now, ignore the code that creates the IO object, we'll get back to
  the IO object in a bit. By calling writeTo in this way, however, Abdera2 
  will print out a nicely formatted JSON object:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
{
  "objectType": "activity",
  "actor": {
    "objectType": "person",
    "displayName": "Joe"
  },
  "verb": "post",
  "object": {
    "objectType": "bookmark",
    "targetUrl": "http://example.org"
  },
  "target": {
    "objectType": "service",
    "displayName": "Sally\u0027s Wall"
  }
}
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>So now we have an Activity, but we do not quite yet have an Activity *Stream*.
  For that, we need to create a stream that contains the activity. If you're
  familiar with the Atom Syndication Format and RSS, Activities and Streams are
  the logical equivalent to Entries and Feeds.</t>
  
  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    Collection<Activity> stream = 
      Collection.<Activity>makeCollection()
      .item(activity)
      .get();
  ]]></artwork></figure>
  
  <t>Once the activity has been added to the stream, we can use the writeTo
  method (and the IO object we created) to output the results:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
{
  "objectType": "collection",
  "totalItems": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "objectType": "activity",
      "actor": {
        "objectType": "person",
        "displayName": "Joe"
      },
      "verb": "post",
      "object": {
        "objectType": "bookmark",
        "targetUrl": "http://example.org"
      },
      "target": {
        "objectType": "service",
        "displayName": "Sally\u0027s Wall"
      }
    }
  ]
}
  </artwork></figure>

  <t>We now have a simple Activity Stream containing exactly one Activity.</t>

  <t>Note that the code example above uses a variety of objects and functions
  that have been statically imported to improve code readability. The imports
  used are shown below. In particular, note the static import of the various
  factory methods (e.g. makeCollection, makeActivity, etc). We'll touch more
  on the Factory API a bit later.</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Collection.makeCollection;
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Activity.makeActivity;
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.objects.PersonObject.makePerson;
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.objects.ServiceObject.makeService;
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.objects.BookmarkObject.makeBookmark;
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Verb.POST;
import org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Activity;
import org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Collection;
import org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.IO;
  </artwork></figure>
  
  </section>
  
  <section title="Reading the Activity Stream">
  
  <t>Reading the Activity Stream is as equally straightforward. Let's
  assume that our Activity Stream has been handed to us in the form of a
  Reader, parsing the stream is as simple as:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Reader reader = ...
Collection<Activity> stream = io.readCollection(reader);
  ]]></artwork></figure>
  
  <t>Note that we're just reusing the IO object from the previous example.</t>
  
  <t>The readCollection method gives us back a Collection object that we can
  then iterate over to extract the Activity:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
for (Activity a : stream.getItems()) {
  System.out.println(a.getActor().getDisplayName());
  System.out.println(a.getVerb());
  System.out.println(a.getObject().getObjectType());
  System.out.println(a.getTarget().getDisplayName());
}
  </artwork></figure>
  
  </section>
  
  <section title="The IO Object">
  
  <t>The IO object is the primary interface through which Activity Streams
  are Serialized and Deserialized. It handles all the details of converting
  between JSON and the Java Objects.</t>
  
  <t>Every IO object is created using a simple factory pattern that is leveraged
  extensively throughout the entire Activity Streams implementation. Once created,
  IO objects are immutable and threadsafe.</t>
  
  <t>There are two basic ways of creating an IO object. The first is to call
  the static get() method on the IO class, which returns an IO object that 
  uses default configuration parameters. One or more TypeAdapters can be 
  passed in as arguments to the get() method, but we'll address TypeAdapters
  later.</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
IO io = IO.get(); // create default, immutable IO object
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>The second way of creating IO is to use the static IO.make() method to 
  create an IO Factory used to configure the IO will non-default options.
  You've already seen one example of using make() in the previous examples.</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
IO io = IO.make()
  .prettyPrint()
  .autoClose()
  .get();
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>Using the IO Factory is most useful when dealing with custom object 
  serializations, which will be covered in more detail later.</t>
  
  <section title="Serializing Objects using IO">
  
    <t>Using the IO object to serialize Activity objects is as simple as
    calling an appropriate write() method. There are a variety of options
    depending on the specific needs of your application:</t>
    
    <figure><preamble>Serialize to a String:</preamble><artwork>
String s = io.write(stream);
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <figure><preamble>Serialize to a Writer</preamble><artwork>
Writer writer = ...
io.write(stream, writer);
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <figure><preamble>Serialize to an OutputStream</preamble><artwork>
OutputStream out = ...
io.write(stream, out);
    </artwork></figure>
  
    <t>One of the more advanced features of the IO object is the ability
    to perform nonblocking serialization and deserialization. This is 
    done by integrating with the mechanisms provided by the 
    java.util.concurrent.* package:</t>
    
    <figure><preamble>Nonblocking Serialization</preamble><artwork>
OutputStream out = ...
ExecutorService exec = MoreExecutors2.getExitingExecutor();
io.write(stream, out, exec);
    </artwork></figure>
    
  </section>
  
  <section title="Deserializing Object using IO">
  
    <t>Using the IO object to deserialize Activity objects is just
    a slightly more complicated in that, because of the typeless 
    nature of JSON Documents, you have to be reasonably sure in 
    advance what exactly it is you're parsing (e.g. individual 
    Activity or a Stream). Calling the io.read() method, IO will
    attempt to make a best guess based on heuristic analysis of the 
    objects content to determine what kind of object is being parsed
    but it doesn't always get it right. Accordingly, if you know 
    that you're parsing a Stream, you should use the appropriate
    readCollection methods. If you know you're parsing an individual
    Activity object, then use the readActivity method.</t>
    
    <figure><preamble>Reading from a String</preamble><artwork><![CDATA[
String s = ...
Collection<Activity>stream = io.readCollection(s)
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    <figure><preamble>Reading from a Reader</preamble><artwork><![CDATA[
Reader reader = ...
Collection<Activity>stream = io.readCollection(reader)
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    <figure><preamble>Reading from an InputStream</preamble><artwork><![CDATA[
InputStream in = ...
Collection<Activity>stream = io.readCollection(in)
    ]]></artwork></figure>
  
    <t>Non-blocking deserialization is also possible:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Reader reader = ...
ExecutorService exec = MoreExecutors2.getExitingExecutor();
io.readCollection(
  reader, 
  exec, 
  new Listener<Collection<Activity>>() {
    public void onComplete(Collection<Activity> stream) {
      // do something with the stream
    }        
  });
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    <t>You can also use a Future to wait for the result:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
Future<Collection<Activity>> future =
  io.readCollection(
  s, 
  MoreExecutors2.getExitingExecutor());
  
Collection<Activity> stream = future.get();
    ]]></artwork></figure>
  
  </section>
  
  </section>
  
  <section title="Creating Objects">
  
  <t>All Activity objects are created using a simple factory pattern. Created
  instances are all Immutable and Threadsafe. Let's look back at the very 
  first example and break it down:</t>
  
    <figure><artwork>
Activity activity =
  makeActivity()
    .actor(makePerson("Joe"))
    .verb(POST)
    .object(makeBookmark("http://example.org"))
    .target(makeService().displayName("Sally's Wall"))
    .get();
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>The first thing you should notice is that the factory uses what is known
  as a <eref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">"Fluent" API</eref>. 
  Another name for this is "method chaining". This pattern is utilized extensively
  throughout Abdera2. If you've never used a Fluent API before, it can take 
  some getting used to, but with some practice it becomes very natural to use.</t>
  
  <t>The makeActivity() method is statically imported from the 
  org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Activity object:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Activity.makeActivity;
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>It returns an ActivityBuilder object that is used to construct our 
  activity. The methods of this object reflect all the various properties
  of the Activity. The call to "actor()" sets the value of the Activities
  "actor" property, etc. Notice how calls to other statically imported
  factory methods are mixed in. Each of these returns builders for their
  own respective types of objects. The makePerson method, for instance, 
  returns a PersonBuilder, whilch makeBookmark returns a BookmarkBuilder.
  The final call to get() triggers the ActivityBuilder to build the immutable
  Activity object using the specified properties.</t>
  
  <t>Let's take a look at another example.</t>
  
  <figure><preamble>Creating a Person Object</preamble><artwork>
PersonObject person = 
  makePerson()
    .displayName("John Doe")
    .email("john.doe@example.org")
    .id("acct:john.doe@example.org")
    .name(makeName()
      .givenName("John")
      .familyName("Doe"))
    .set("foo","bar")
    .get();
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>If we call the writeTo method on the person object we can get an 
  idea of the JSON produced by this code:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
{
  "objectType": "person",
  "displayName": "John Doe",
  "id": "acct:john.doe@example.org",
  "name": {
    "objectType": "name",
    "givenName": "John",
    "familyName": "Doe"
  },
  "foo": "bar",
  "emails": [
    "john.doe@example.org"
  ]
}
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>The Activity Streams implementation supports a broad range of specific
  object types like PersonObject that will be discussed shortly. These are 
  designed to be composed together with Activities as the values of the 
  actor, object and target properties.</t>
  
    <section title="Object Templates">
    
    <t>All Activity Objects, once created, are immutable. To modify the 
    properties of an object, we need to use it as a template to create
    a new object entirely.</t>
    
    <t>Suppose, for example, that we wish to add a property to the 
    person object example given previously:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
person = 
 person.<PersonObject,PersonBuilder>template()
 .aboutMe("This is John Doe")
 .get();
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    <t>The template() method is available on all objects and returns a
    builder object appropriate for that type. By default, the builder 
    will have all the properties of the original object set. If you 
    wish to change the value of an existing property, you must create 
    a template that filters out the value to be modified:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.ASBase.withoutFields;
//....    
person = 
  person.<PersonObject,PersonBuilder>template(withoutFields("emails"))
  .email("john.doe@example2.org")
  .get();
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    </section>
    
    <section title="Changing Object Types">
    
    <t>There are occasions, albeit rare, that you'll need to treat one
    kind of object as if it were another type. This is most common when 
    IO ends up generating the wrong kind of object during parse. Every
    object supports an as() method that creates a new instance of the 
    desired type with a copy of the source objects properties.</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
ServiceObject service = person.as(ServiceObject.class);
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>The ability to convert objects like this leads to some rather 
    interesting advanced capabilities that are beyond the scope of 
    this getting started guide. Advanced topics will be covered 
    separately.</t>
    
    </section>
    
    <section title="Type-Safe Extension">
    
    <t>Activity Stream objects are arbitrarily extensible. That is, new 
    properties can be added to any object type at any time. The basic 
    builder for each object supports a generic set property whose arguments
    take a string and any arbitrary object as the value. This is useful, 
    but it's not typesafe. For instance, suppose our application requires
    that a Person have an extension property named "friendCount" whose 
    value must be a integer. Using set, there's no way for us to enforce 
    that constraint:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
PersonObject person = 
  makePerson()
    .displayName("John Doe")
    .set("friendCount","1")
    .get();
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>To enforce type-safety constraints, Abdera2 supports an alternative. 
    First, let's define an extension interface:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
public static interface MyExt extends Extra.ExtensionBuilder {
  MyExt friendCount(int i);
}
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Then, let's extend the PersonBuilder dynamically,</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
PersonObject person = 
  makePerson()
    .displayName("John Doe")
    .extend(MyExt.class)
    .friendCount(10)
    .<PersonBuilder>unwrap()
    .get();
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Note that "friendCount" is now set in a manner that is completely
    type-safe, and we maintain our Fluent API pattern.</t>
    
    <t>The objects themselves can also be extended in similar fashion:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
public static interface MyExt2 extends Extra.ExtensionObject {
  int getFriendCount();
}

int fc = person.extend(MyExt2.class).getFriendCount();
    </artwork></figure>
    
    </section>
  
  </section>
  
  <section title="Using CollectionWriter">
  
  <t>The CollectionWriter interface provides a simplified interface for
  streaming serialization of collections of Activity objects.</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
CollectionWriter cw = 
  io.getCollectionWriter(System.out, "UTF-8");
cw.writeObject(
  makeActivity()
    .verb(POST)
    .actor(makePerson("Joe"))
    .object(makeBookmark("http://example.org")));
  </artwork></figure>
  
  </section>
    
  <section title="Custom Type Adapters and Property Mappings">
    <t>Out of the box, the IO object is capable of working with a broad
    range of simple and complex object types, including most of the 
    types typically associated with Atom and Activity Streams implementations
    (Joda-Time DateTime objects, Entity Tags, URI Templates, Collection
    objects, Maps, etc). However, there are occasions when an application
    has to use a custom class object.</t>
    
    <t>For instance, suppose we have the following class:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  public static class MyObject {
    private final String val;
    public MyObject(String v) {
      this.val = v;
    }
    public String toString() {
      return val;
    }
    public String getVal() {
      return val;
    }
  }
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>We want to be able to set an instance of MyObject as the value of 
    an Activity Objects "foo" property, like so:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  PersonObject person = 
    makePerson("Joe")
      .set("foo", new MyObject("bar"));
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>When serialized into JSON, we want this is appear as a regular 
    String field:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  {
    "objectType":"person",
    "displayName":"Joe",
    "foo":"bar"
  }
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>When parsing that JSON, however, we want the "foo" property to 
    be interpreted as a MyObject instance so that calling object.getProperty("foo")
    returns MyObject. To achieve that goal, we first need to create a custom 
    type adapter:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  @AdaptedType(MyObject.class)
  public static class MyObjectAdapter
    extends SimpleAdapter<MyObject> {
    protected MyObject deserialize(String v) {
      return new MyObject(v);
    }    
  }  
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    <t>The org.apache.abdera2.activities.io.gson.SimpleAdapter class is an
    abstract base class that handles most of the difficult work for us. By
    default, it uses the custom objects toString() method to serialize the 
    object into a JSON string. If you need a more complex serialization, 
    you will need to overload the serialize method.</t>
    
    <t>Note the use of the @AdaptedType annotation, this is required for
    custom type adapters. It tells the IO class which type of object this
    custom adapter is for.</t>
    
    <t>Once created, we need to register the type adapter with the IO object
    and tell it to associate the "foo" property with MyObject instances:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  IO io = IO.make()
    .adapter(new MyObjectAdapter())
    .property("foo", MyObject.class)
    .get();
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Note that we're creating a new instance of the IO object. Since IO
    objects are immutable, custom type adapters and property assignments 
    MUST be set up during the construction of the IO object. Once the IO
    instance is created, we can proceed as usual:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  PersonObject person = 
    makePerson("Joe")
      .set("foo", new MyObject("bar"));
  String str = io.write(base);
  // now parse it to check..
  person = io.readObject(new StringReader(str));
  MyObject obj = person.getProperty("foo");
  System.out.println(obj.getVal());
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Note that you need to take care when mapping property names to specific
    kinds of objects because IO will attempt to treat all instances of that 
    property name as the given object type. This will cause problems if you
    use the same property name with different types of values within a single
    document.</t>
    
    <t>By default, IO uses the following property mappings -- meaning that 
    whenever fields with these names are encountered in a document, they 
    will automatically be interpreted as the given type. You can override
    the default interpretation by registering your own property mapping during
    IO construction.</t>

    <t>Note that property mapping applies even if the properties value is
    an array, for instance, given our custom type mapping using the MyObject
    class, "foo":["bar","baz"] would be interpreted as collection of MyObject
    values:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  PersonObject person = io.readObject(new StringReader(str));
  Iterable<MyObject> list = person.getProperty("foo");
  for (MyObject obj : list) {...}

  <section title="Object Types">
    <t>The Activity Streams model is extensible, allowing developers to 
    describe any type of activity with any type of object. As part of the
    standard, Activity Streams defines a handful of common basic object
    types and provides the mechanism for creating more. Abdera2 supports
    all of the core standard object types and introduces a number of its
    own. Refer to the API Documentation for details on each of Abdera's 
    provided object types.</t>
    
    <t>To support creation of new object types, Abdera2 gives you the 
    choice of either using the dynamic org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.ASObject
    API or the ability to extend the core objects to create a static extension.</t>
    
    <t>Creating a new object type using the dynamic API is simple:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  ASObject myObject = 
    ASObject.makeObject()
      .objectType("foo")
      .displayName("My Foo Object")
      .set("bar","baz")
      .get();
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>When serialized, this will look like:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  {
    "objectType":"foo",
    "displayName":"My Foo Object",
    "bar":"baz"
  }
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Creating a new static object type requires a few more steps but 
    is pretty straightforward:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  public class FooObject
    extends ASObject {
  
    public static <T extends FooObject>Builder makeFoo() {
      return new Builder("foo");
    }
  
    @Name("foo")
    public static final class Builder extends ASObject.Builder<FooObject,Builder> {
      public Builder() {
        super(FooObject,Builder.class);
      }
      public Builder(String objectType) {
        super(objectType,FooObject,Builder.class);
      }
      public Builder(Map<String,Object> map) {
        super(map,FooObject,Builder.class);
      }
      public Builder bar(String val) {
        set("bar","val");
        return this;
      }
    }
  
    public FooObject(Map<String,Object> map) {
      super(map,Builder.class,FooObject.class);
    }
  
    public <X extends FooObject, M extends ASObject.Builder<X,M>>FooObject(Map<String,Object> map, Class<M> _class, Class<X>_obj) {
      super(map,_class,_obj);
    }
    
    public String getBar() {
      return getProperty("bar");
    }
  }
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Here, we're creating two objects: FooObject and FooObject.Builder. 
    FooObject.Builder extends from the core ASObject.Builder and provides
    all the necessary methods for constructing immutable instances of 
    the FooObject class. FooObject extends from ASObject, inheriting all 
    of the core Activity object fields and introducing a single extension
    field called "bar".</t>
    
    <t>Once defined, we can use our custom object type:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  FooObject foo = 
    FooObject.makeFoo()
      .displayName("My Foo Object")
      .bar("baz")
      .get();
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>The output is identical to that produced by the dynamic API:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  {
    "objectType":"foo",
    "displayName":"My Foo Object",
    "bar":"baz"
  }
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>The final step is to register your custom object type with IO, in 
    order to have IO automatically generate instances of your custom
    object type when encountered within a document:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  IO io = IO.make()
    .object(FooObject.Builder.class);
    .get();
    
  FooObject foo = io.readObject(...);
    </artwork></figure>
    
  </section>
  
  <section title="Custom Verbs">
    <t>Another key extension point within Activity Streams are the 
    use of custom verbs. Within the standard, a collection of common
    verbs are defined and supported by Abdera, along with a handful of
    additional extension verbs. These include:</t>
    
    <t><list>
 <t>add</t>
 <t>cancel</t>
 <t>checkin</t>
 <t>delete</t>
 <t>favorite</t>
 <t>follow</t>
 <t>give</t>
 <t>ignore</t>
 <t>invite</t>
 <t>join</t>
 <t>leave</t>
 <t>like</t>
 <t>make-friend</t>
 <t>post</t>
 <t>play</t>
 <t>receive</t>
 <t>remove</t>
 <t>remove-friend</t>
 <t>request-friend</t>
 <t>rsvp-maybe</t>
 <t>rsvp-no</t>
 <t>rsvp-yes</t>
 <t>save</t>
 <t>share</t>
 <t>stop-following</t>
 <t>tag</t>
 <t>unfavorite</t>
 <t>unlike</t>
 <t>unsave</t>
 <t>update</t>
 <t>comment</t>
 <t>purchase</t>  
 <t>consume</t>
 <t>host</t>
 <t>read</t>
 <t>approve</t>
 <t>reject</t>
 <t>archive</t>
 <t>install</t>
 <t>close</t>
 <t>open</t>
 <t>resolve</t>
    </list></t>
    
      <t>Each of these common verbs correlate to a constant on the 
  org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.Verb object. Whenever possible,
  applications should always use an existing verb. However, there are 
  cases when a new verb must be created.</t>
  
  <t>There are a couple points to keep in mind when creating a new verb:
  1) They are always a single token value, whitespace is not allowed and
  2) They are always case-insensitive, "Post" is equivalent to "post".</t>
  
  <t>To create a new verb within Abdera2, simple call the Verb.get() method,
  passing in the name of the verb:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
  Activity activity = 
    Activity.makeActivity()
      .actor(PersonObject.makePerson("Me")))
      .verb(<b>Verb.get("foo")</b>)
      .object(NoteObject.makeNote("A Note"))
      .get();
  </artwork></figure>
  </section>
  
  <section title="Replies and Responses">
  
  <t>The "Responses for Activity Streams" 
  <eref target="http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/replies/1.0/">specification</eref> 
  defines an extensions to Activity Streams that support threaded conversations.
  Support for the extension has been built into Abdera2.</t>
  
  <t>Any Activity Streams object may have an "inReplyTo" property, whose 
  value is an array of one or more objects for which the containing object
  is considered a response. The conceptual model is generally identical to
  that defined by the <eref target="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4685.txt">Atom Threading Extensions</eref>.</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
    NoteObject note = NoteObject
      .makeNote()
      .id("urn:foo")
      .content("This is a note")
      .get();
    NoteObject comment = NoteObject
      .makeNote()
      .id("urn:bar")
      .content("This is a comment")
      <b>.inReplyTo(note)</b>
      .get();
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>A common application use case is the ability to show the number of 
  responses that are known for a given type of object. For that, the 
  responses specification defines a number of common property names 
  that are mapped to Activity Collection object values. These include:</t>
  
  <t><list>
  <t>attending</t>
  <t>followers</t>
  <t>following</t>
  <t>friends</t>
  <t>friend-requests</t>
  <t>likes</t>
  <t>notAttending</t>
  <t>maybeAttending</t>
  <t>members</t>
  <t>replies</t>
  <t>reviews</t>
  <t>saves</t>
  <t>shares</t>
  </list></t>
  
  <t>For example, if I have a note object that has received two comments,
  has been shared by one person, and liked by five people, within the JSON
  serialization it would look something like:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
  {
    "objectType":"note",
    "content":"This is a note",
    "replies":{
      "totalItems":2,
      "items":[
        {"objectType":"note",
         "content":"This is a comment"},
        {"objectType":"note",
         "content":"This is another comment"}
      ]
    },
    "shares":{
      "totalItems":1,
      "items":[
        {"objectType":"person",
         "displayName":"Joe"}
      ]
    },
    "likes":{
      "totalItems":5
    }
  }
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>Within the Abdera2 API, this would be:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  NoteObject note = io.readObject(...);
  Collection<ASObject> replies = note.getProperty("replies");
  Collection<ASObject> shares = note.getProperty("shares");
  Collection<ASObject> likes = note.getProperty("likes");
  
  System.out.println(
    String.format(
      "%d Comments, %d Shares, %d Likes",
      replies.getTotalItems(),
      shares.getTotalItems(),
      likes.getTotalItems());
  ]]></artwork></figure>

  <section title="Audience Targeting">
    <t>The "Audience Targeting for JSON Activities"
    <eref target="http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/targeting/1.0/">specification</eref>
    defines a set of extension properties used to identify the target audience 
    of the activity. Each of these properties ("to","cc","bto" and "bcc") are
    defined as arrays of objects. For instance:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  {
    "to":[{"objectType":"person","displayName":"Joe"},
          {"objectType":"person","displayName":"Sally"}],
    "bto":[{"alias":"@network"}]
  }
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Abdera2 includes built in support for the Audience Targeting extension:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
  Activity activity = 
    Activity.makeActivity()
      .actor(PersonObject.makePerson("James"))
      .verb(Verb.POST)
      .object(NoteObject.makeNote().content("Test").get())
      .target(ServiceObject.makeService().id("urn:my:wall").get())
      .to(PersonObject.makePerson("Joe"))
      .to(PersonObject.makePerson("Sally"))
      .bto(Objects.NETWORK)   
      .get();
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>Once created, you can use an extensive array of static methods from the
    org.apache.abdera2.activities.extra.Extra class to determine the audience
    of an activity, for instance:</t>
    
    <figure><artwork>
    import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.objects.PersonObject.*;
    import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.extra.Extra.*;
    
    isToMeOr(makePerson("Joe").get()).select(activity); // true
    isTo(makePerson("Joe").get()).select(activity); // true
    isCc(makePerson("Jane").get()).select(activity); // false
    isBccMe().select(activity); // false
    isBtoNetwork().select(activity); // true
    isTo(makePerson("Joe").id("urn:foo").get()).select(activity); // false
    </artwork></figure>
    
    <t>The audience testing methods are integrated with the Abdera2 Selector
    framework making it possible to filter Activity Streams based on the 
    audience. For instance, suppose you want to grab only the activities 
    from a stream that are targeted directly to Joe (using the "to" property):</t>
    
    <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.model.objects.PersonObject.*;
  import static org.apache.abdera2.activities.extra.Extra.*;
    
  Collection<Activity> stream = io.readCollection(...);
  Iterable<Activity> items = 
    stream.getItems(
      isTo(makePerson("Joe").get());
  for (Activity activity : items) {...}
    ]]></artwork></figure>
    
  </section>
  
  <section title="Comparing Activity Objects">
  
  <t>One important case is the ability to compare two instances of an object
  to determine what has changed from one to the other. Abdera2 supports a 
  coarse-grained mechanism for comparing the differences between objects.</t>
  
  <t>For example,</t>
  
  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    PersonObject person1 = 
      PersonObject.makePerson()
        .displayName("Joe")
        .set("foo","bar")
        .set("bar","baz")
        .get();
    
    PersonObject person2 = 
      person1.<PersonObject,PersonBuilder>template(
        ASBase.withoutFields("foo","bar"))
        .set("bar","xyz")
        .set("baz",123)
        .get();
    
    Difference diff = person1.diff(person2);
    
    System.out.println(diff);
  ]]></artwork></figure>
  
  <t>Here, we create one Person object with displayName = "Joe" and 
  two extension properties named "foo" and "bar". We then use that 
  object as a template to create a second one. Doing so, we remove 
  the existing "foo" and "bar" fields and add a different "bar" field
  and a new "baz" field. Serialized as JSON, these two objects look
  something like:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
  {
    "objectType":"person",
    "displayName":"Joe",
    "foo":"bar",
    "bar":"baz"
  }
  
  {
    "objectType":"person",
    "displayName":"Joe",
    "bar":"xyz",
    "baz":123
  }
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>The call to person1.diff(person2) results in the creation of a Difference
  object that contains a summary of the differences between the two objects:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
    Difference diff = person1.diff(person2);
    System.out.println(diff);
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>Which outputs:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork>
  Changes: [[bar,[baz,xyz]]]
  Added:   [[baz,123]]
  Removed: [[foo,bar]]
  </artwork></figure>
  
  <t>We can step through the changes using the Difference object:</t>
  
  <figure><artwork><![CDATA[
  for (Pair<String,Pair<Object,Object>> change : diff.changed()) {
    String field = change.first();
    Pair<Object,Object> values = change.second();
    Object origValue = values.first();
    Object newValue = values.second();
    System.out.println(
      String.format(
        "Field '%s' changed from '%s' to '%s'",
        field,
        origValue,
        newValue));
  }
