    // Every object and activity has an "id" property.. when
    // an object gets passed around through multiple parties,
    // the "id" of the object may change but the object itself
    // stays the same. The changing id can make it difficult to
    // detect duplicates of the same object so the Activity
    // Streams specification provides two properties called
    // "downstreamDuplicates" and "upstreamDuplicates", both of
    // which are arrays that can be used to record to known 
    // id's of a single object. A basic equals() check on the
    // Activity cannot determine if the objects are actually
    // duplicates with different ids. For that, we provide 
    // two alternative Equivalence functions, one that bases
    // it's decision solely on the values of the "id" properties,
    // and another that properly compares all known ids recorded
    // using the "id", "downstreamDuplicates" and "upsteamDuplicates"
    // property values.
    
    // first we create two activities that have different "id" values,
    // but share common values in their downstream and upstream duplicates.
    // basically, we're saying that an object with the "id":"baz" is a 
    // known derivative of the first Activity object we create with "id":"foo", 
    // and we're saying that an Activity with the "id":"bar" is itself a 
    // derivative of "id":"baz" .... so even those our two activities
    // do not know about each other directly, we can related the two
    // and detect that they are likely duplicates of one another

    // within the root collection object that is used to
