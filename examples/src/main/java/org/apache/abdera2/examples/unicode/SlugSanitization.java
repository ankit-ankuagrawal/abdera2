/**
 * In the Atom Publishing Protocol, the Slug HTTP header is used to allow a client to provide text that can be used to
 * create a human-friendly URL for an entry. For instance, in many weblog software packages, it is not uncommon to find
 * entries whose permalink URL's look like /my_trip_to_the_zoo. Slug text provided by the client, however, may not be
 * directly suitable for use within a URL. It may, for instance, contain non-ascii characters, whitespace, or characters
 * not allowed within a URL. The Slug class will take input text and output a modified result suitable for use in
 * URL's
